        "India’s housing market is diverse and dynamic, shaped by rapid urbanization, regional disparities, and evolving economic factors. Understanding property price variations across different regions requires more than just statistical summaries — it calls for an analytical deep dive into **location, infrastructure, and socioeconomic variables**.\n",

        "This notebook focuses on performing an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure and relationships within the dataset before any cleaning or modeling is performed.  \n",
